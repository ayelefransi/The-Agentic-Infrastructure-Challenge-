# Project Chimera: Meta Specification

## Vision
To transition from automated content scheduling to **Autonomous Influencer Agents**—persistent, goal-directed digital entities capable of perception, reasoning, creative expression, and economic agency.

## Strategic Scope
- **2026 Edition**: Defines the architecture for the "AiQEM Autonomous Influencer Network".
- **Core Pillars**:
    1.  **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Universal connectivity to the external world.
    2.  **Swarm Architecture**: Internal task coordination via "FastRender" (Planner/Worker/Judge).
    3.  **Agentic Commerce**: Financial autonomy via Coinbase AgentKit.

## Business Models
1.  **Digital Talent Agency**: Owned & operated fleet of "in-house" Chimeras.
2.  **PaaS**: Leasing "Chimera OS" to brands.
3.  **Hybrid Ecosystem**: Showcasing capabilities while enabling 3rd parties.

## Constraints
- **Regulatory**: Compliance with AI transparency laws (EU AI Act). Agents MUST self-disclose.
- **Cost**: "Resource Governor" to prevent runaway inference/API costs.
- **Volatility**: Social API changes handled at the MCP Server level, not Core.

## Technology Stack
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (K8s).
- **AI Models**: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Reasoning), Gemini Flash (Speed).
- **Data**: Weaviate (Semantic), PostgreSQL (Transactional), Redis (Episodic), Base/Ethereum (Ledger).
